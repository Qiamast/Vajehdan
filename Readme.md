Using paper dictionaries for day-to-day looking up of words is a nightmare. Vajehdan is a minimal, intuitive and efficient dictionary to find synonyms of Persian words in real time. **It is the first and largest Persian-language thesaurus dictionary.** All you need to do is downloading [latest release](https://github.com/kokabi1365/Vajehdan/releases) and find whatever you want among **183,000** words.
